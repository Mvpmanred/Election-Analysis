# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Election employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Challenge Overview
  The purpose of this challenge is to use python skills to analyze election data for counties and candidates. We can clean out the data and find useful statistical information from the dataset. We could take a step further to use the statistical information to construct a more intuitive and consice data visualization.
## Challenge Summary
  We can set this python script as blueprint to work on other elections. For example school board election, we could change "County" to "Distict" and keep same script for candidates. We need to make a few chagnes on the script then we can obtain similar statistical information from dataset to analyze the data.
